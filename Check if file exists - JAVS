#following the news about the JAVS supply chain attack, I found this script and modified it to work/target JAVS. Notable issues are that it only checks for the file (if it still exists) on the c drive.
#works for my purposes.

$fileName = "JAVS.Viewer8.Setup_8.3.7.250-1.exe"
 
$foundFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\" -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq $fileName }
 
if ($foundFiles) {
  foreach ($file in $foundFiles) {
    Write-Output "File found at $($file.FullName)"
    Write-Error -message "file present"
     }
    } else
      { Write-Output "File named $fileName not found on C: drive"
       }
